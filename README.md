Understanding Appium

## Note - I do not claim that this is my original work. This is just a compilation of the open source available information and tried to make it easier to understand and implement.


### What is Appium? and Why to use?
* Appium is an open-source tool for automation testing for mobile applications. 
* Appium can be used to test native, hybrid and mobile web applications on both Android and iOS platforms. 
* It is a cross-platform tool which allows to write test againts multiple platforms using the same API. 
* This reduces the efforts to rewrite code for different platforms and the same code can be reused for all the platforms.
* Appium allows to choose the language to write the tests.
* Appium supports automation tests on Physical devices and Emulator/Simulator.

#### Write tests in any language like Java, Ruby, Python, PHP etc. as per your convenience and use them to automate Android and iOS, isn't that sound cool !!
